# McAfee_Assessment_project
The project is about to use hive and Tableau to analyze crime incidents in the Dallas city over years, and to find out the potential factors that may affect the incidents. I used the open sources found on dallasopenata. Here is partial analysis data and codes associated with this project.
The original data file Police_Incident.csv is larger than 100MB, and cannot upload. I choose the first 600 rows in the file to let you have a general idea of the data stucture. I create a report file includes the screenshots of the codes and tableau reports I used.
the "code" file is partial codes I used in th project generated using hive.
